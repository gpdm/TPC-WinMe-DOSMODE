
The versions of PIFMGR.DLL and WINOA386.MOD included by default in this pre-release build of the MS-DOS Mode Patch for Windows Me are from Millennium Developer Release 1 (Build 2332).

This folder ("98_FILES") contains the Windows 98 SE versions of these files instead, with version checks patched out to ensure they run on Windows Me. They are included in this bundle for experimentation purposes only, should someone wish to substitute them to see if these earlier versions correct any potential issues that may arise.
