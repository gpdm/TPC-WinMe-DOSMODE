# DOS Mode for Windows Millenium Edition

This is the initial import of the inofficial DOS Mode for Windows Millenium Edition.

This prerelease was originally [sourced from app.box.com](https://app.box.com/s/jfiy8p0m2p2vbvh4zzolznh3lp2yanfe),
and is the work of user iMic, who had posted this initially on the [MSFN.org](https://msfn.org/board/topic/184833-full-featured-real-mode-dos-in-windows-millennium/)
and [overclockers.com.au](https://forums.overclockers.com.au/threads/showing-windows-me-some-love.1311910/page-2#post-19360466) forums.

See also the included [README.TXT](README.TXT) and [NOTES.TXT](NOTES.TXT) for more details about this initial release.

This initial copy remains 1:1 unchanged to the original release, and was imported to base my further
improvements upon.

Any future releases in the [TPC-WinMe-DOSMODE](https://github.com/gpdm/TPC-WinMe-DOSMODE) repository will deviate
from this original release.
